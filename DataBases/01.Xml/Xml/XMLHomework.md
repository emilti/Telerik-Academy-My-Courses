## XML Basics
### _Homework_

1.XML stands for Extensible Markup Language.
It is universal language (notation) for describing structured data using text with tags
The data is stored together with the meta-data about it.
Used to describe other languages (formats) for data representation.

3.An XML namespace is declared using the reserved XML attribute xmlns or xmlns:prefix, the value of which must be a valid namespace name.
Namespaces in XML documents allow using different tags with the same name. 
A simple example would be to consider an XML instance that contained references to a customer and an ordered product. Both the customer element and the product element could have a child element named id. References to the id element would therefore be ambiguous; placing them in different namespaces would remove the ambiguity.
